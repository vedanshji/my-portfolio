A code-slingin’ dreamer from India, blending tech with a splash of stardust. 🌠 Obsessed with AI, Deep Learning, DevOps and all things Gen AI — basically turning sci-fi into real life. 🤯💡 When I’m not arguing with my code like it’s my ex, I’m chasing sunsets for the ‘Gram, calling my blurry pics “aesthetic” 📸, managing chaos like it’s a group project (and I’m the only one working), or driving like Google Maps just said “good luck.” 🗺️💥Brains, vibes, and big dreams — that’s the energy. Let’s make magic with code. 💫👨‍💻",
